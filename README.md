# parking a virtual car: genetic algorithm vs. q-learning 

This repository contains a python implementation of an automatic parallel parking system in a virtual environment.
We implemented both genetic algorithm and q-learning algorithm to compare their performances in this task with different situations. 

## Envroinment
we used an open source virtual environment we found on GITHUB:
https://github.com/Pandas-Team/Automatic-Parking

## genetic algorithm
need to add

## g-learning
need to add

## About Us 
This is the final project we submitted as part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
